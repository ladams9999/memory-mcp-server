# Instructions for Maintaining TODO.md

1. At the start of each milestone, update the top section to identify the milestone, expected outcome, and link to the milestone issue.
2. Group all tasks by their Epic issue, including a link to each Epic issue.
3. Keep task status (checked/unchecked) in sync with GitHub issues.
4. Updates should flow both ways: from GitHub issues into TODO.md, and from TODO.md into GitHub issues.
5. When a new milestone begins, archive or move the previous milestone's tasks as needed.
6. Use this file as a local reference and synchronization point for milestone progress.
7. When marking a task as complete, only mark the checkbox (change [ ] to [x]) and make no other changes to the file unless explicitly instructed.
