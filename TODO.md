## Issues Identified on 2025-07-25

### âœ… RESOLVED: MCP Integration Testing Issues
- **Issue**: MCP Memory Server was running but MCP tools were not accessible via VS Code MCP integration
- **Root Cause**: Memory tools import was missing from main.py 
- **Resolution**: Added `from mcp_memory_server.tools import memory_tools` import to main.py
- **Verification**: Server restarted, tools registered successfully, functionality verified with test scripts
- **Results**: Successfully stored 24 memories (14 PRD features + 10 project state records), semantic search working with high relevance scores (0.78-0.90)

## Epic: Documentation & Final Packaging
Epic Issue: https://github.com/ladams9999/memory-mcp-server/issues/8

- [x] Write comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
- [ ] Document all MCP tools with examples
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Document environment variables and configuration options
- [ ] Add example usage scenarios
- [ ] Test complete installation from scratch
- [ ] Verify all dependencies install correctly with UV
- [ ] Test with fresh Ollama installation
- [ ] Package for distribution (if needed)
- [ ] Create release checklist

# Instructions for Maintaining TODO.md

1. At the start of each milestone, update the top section to identify the milestone, expected outcome, and link to the milestone issue.
2. Group all tasks by their Epic issue, including a link to each Epic issue.
3. Keep task status (checked/unchecked) in sync with GitHub issues.
4. Updates should flow both ways: from GitHub issues into TODO.md, and from TODO.md into GitHub issues.
5. When a new milestone begins, archive or move the previous milestone's tasks as needed.
6. Use this file as a local reference and synchronization point for milestone progress.
7. When marking a task as complete, only mark the checkbox (change [ ] to [x]) and make no other changes to the file unless explicitly instructed.
